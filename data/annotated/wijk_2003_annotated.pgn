1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6
{ This is rapidly becoming the most commonly played move amongst the top GMs. }
3. d4
{ This is the more-or-less Classical approach: move a couple of pawns, develop rapidly and look for ways to utilize those pieces. }
 (3. Nc3 
{ is another recent innovation which is based on the idea that it's still unclear where Bf1 should be developed and it's not yet certain that White should play d2-d4. Another similar idea is to meet 2...d6 with 3. Bc4, not committing to a severe weakening of the a1-h8 diagonal. }) 3...cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 (4...g6 
{ The Accelerated Dragon is interesting, but can be met by c2-c4 (Maroczy Bind) . }) 5. Nc3 e5
{ Sveshnikov - The idea is to control the center with his extra pawn (Pd7 & Pe7 vs. White's Pe4) and to do so in a way that lets him activate his two bishops more fully than in a Scheveningen; it's somewhat like a Boleslavsky set-up. But, White's pieces aren't placed the same as in a Boleslavsky; instead White goes directly for the weak spots and induces as much weakness in Black's position as possible (capitalizing if possible) . }
 (5...d6)  (5...e6) 6. Ndb5
{ aiming to invade at d6 to gain a bishop for the knight. It forces Black to play ...d7-d6 which blocks-in Bf8. Black will have at least one bad bishop and a weak d5 square. }
6...d6 7. Bg5
{ Removing Nf6 will ensure White control of d5 for some time and perhaps force a weakened king-side pawn structure which might be exploited later. }
7...a6 8. Na3 (8. Bxf6 gxf6 9. Na3) 8...b5
{ When this opening was originally played it was thought ...Bc8-e6 was best, but ...b5 (the Chelyabinsk Variation) has become most common. There's the immediate threat of ...b4 and it offers ...Bc8-b7 as an option. It also prevents Bf1-c4. }
9. Nd5 (9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5) 9...Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3
{ preparing several things at once: Bf1-e2 while avoiding ...Nd4 and clearing for Na3-c2. After all that it holds square b4, so that a2-a4 threatens massive destruction of Black's queen-side. }
11...Bg5
{ Black has the two bishops, but no immediate way to use them, so he develops normally and hangs on for dear life. }
12. Nc2 O-O 13. a4 bxa4 14. Rxa4 a5 15. Bc4
{ The plan with Bf1-c4 is one Kasparov has played and it tries to keep control of the position to allow a longer build-up before White tries to win. }
 (15. h4 
{ doesn't necessarily gain more than it gives up. White's king-side isn't as safe as before. Instead, it's probably better to focus on the queen-side with moves like Bf1-b5, O-O and so-on. }
 15...Bh6) 15...Rb8
{ prevents Bc4-b5, threatens Pb2 and avoids problems stemming from the pin on Pa5 }
16. b3 Kh8
{ At last, Black can preparing some offense with ...f7-f5, though it's hard to see how he can achieve much when Rb8 & Nc6 are tied to the defense. On the other hand, Nc2 isn't particularly active at the moment, so White hasn't many defensive pieces on the king-side. }
17. O-O f5 18. exf5 Bxf5
{ This seems to me to be a key moment for White: it's from here she has to decide on a middle-game plan which will range across the entire board. Black isn't making any specific threats just yet, but the two bishops (Bf5, Bg5) and Rf8 look ominous. I'd suggest not letting Bg5 move to clear for ...Qd8-g5 or ...Qd8-h4, but there is also ...Qd8-e8-g6, so White has to act fast before a calamity happens. }

 21. Qxd3 Rxb3 22. Qc4 Rb2 23. Qxc6 Rxc2) 21. Ra3 Ne7
{ If he's going to fight on light squares then it certainly makes sense to consider ...Ne7, but it weakens Pa5. A key question still remains and that's how Black might try to use Bg5 and how White can reposition Nc2. It might become obvious that Nc2-e3 is necessary, even if it allows Black to trade-off Bg5. }
22. Be4 (22. Nce3 
{ Fritz7 }) 22...Nxd5 (22...Bb5 $2 23. Qh5 
{ and suddenly everything is complicated! }) 23. Bxd5 Qb6
{ "hitting" e3 to make Nc2-e3 less appealing to White. It also stays in touch with Pa5 and Pb3 and cooperates with Bg5 at a distance. This isn't a plan to win the game, just to maintain cohesion of his position and to keep a little pressure on White. Now is the time for White to return to the main idea of removing Pa5 to make Pb3 a passer. }
 (23...Qc7 
{ Fritz7 }) 24. b4 (24. Rfa1 
{ Mark and Fritz7 agree! }) 24...axb4 25. Nxb4
{ Though cxb4 would make a passer it also allows ...Bb5 and leaves Nc2 awkwardly placed. Nb4 can be useful and there is still some hope of playing simultaneously against Pd6 and Ph7. }
25...Qc5
{ threatening ...Rxb4 and ...Qxd5 or ...Bb5 }
26. Qa2 Bb5 27. c4
{ White courageously gambits a pawn to keep Rf1 securely defending Pf2 and to keep solid light-square control (so, after all this Black does get to trade a bishop for the knight, just not Bg5!) . }

{ At the end Polgar could force an entry to Black's king with 37. Ra7+ Kh6 38. Bxe4 Rxe4 39. Qf7. Curiously, Polgar also drew a pawn-down ending against Kramnik (in this event) , beginning with this same opening. One has to wonder what brought the position to this; where White was doing well, but then has to give a pawn and hope to draw. Isn't this a mysterious kind of thing? I suppose White was not fully developed and active (Nc2) and holding back to avoid trades gave Black compensation for the other weaknesses in Black's position. In the end it was those same weaknesses which gave White compensation for the lost pawn. It's back to the drawing board to find a better plan for White. }

{ Black controls the center and pecks away at White's efforts. }
3. Nc3
{ This classical approach is aimed at supporting e2-e4, so that he will have three strong pawns (Pc4, Pd4, Pe4) with which to bludgeon Black. Naturally Black shouldn't allow this. }
3...Bb4
{ Nimzo-Indian Defense - very popular in this event }
4. e3
{ White recognizes the need for further piece development and begins a slow build-up. There is also the possibility of Ng1-e2 and a2-a3 to force Bb4 away, thus keeping Black cramped. }
 (
{ Avoiding doubled c-file pawns is very popular. }
 4. Qc2) 4...O-O
{ Another plan, the Hubner Variation, is to capture at c3, giving White doubled pawns, and then to play the Black central pawns onto dark squares, thereby replacing (to some extent) the missing dark-square bishop. Some players are reluctant to relinquish the bishop. }
5. Nge2
{ This Rubinstein Variation aims to force Bb4 to trade for Nc3 or to retreat. Trading gives White a small gain with no cost and the retreat leaves Black without sufficient central control. At least that's the Classical take on this position. I think the first part is right, but the second has to be taken with a grain of salt because Ne2 isn't very good and Bc1 is blocked-in behind Pe3. If Black plays ...d7-d5 or possibly even ...c7-c5 then he's probably alright. It doesn't take a lot of pawn moves to control the center. }
5...d5 6. a3
{ Curiously, this pawn appears to be a small prod to Bb4, but later it serves as a threat, inhibiting Black from playing ...b7-b5 because of the danger that Pc7 might be kept backward and weak after b2-b4. }

{ Now Black has a pawn controlling e4, so Ne2 is awkwardly blocking Bf1. On the other hand Bc8 is also blocked by another pawn on a light square. Both players have problems to solve. }

{ This is one of the variations Polgar plays, so it appears Timman has decided she might not like to face it from the other side. Unlike variations with ...d7-d6 where Black uses an early ...Ng8-f6 to (more-or-less) force White into Nb1-c3 before c2-c4, in this variation the threat of an early ...Bf8-b4 helps to serve the same purpose. The thorny light square pawn structure also inhibits Bf1-c4. So, White usually aims for a Classical set-up with Nb1-c3, Bf1-e2, O-O and possibly Bc1-e3. This is one good way to get a "normal" Scheveningen position without facing the Sozin (Bf1-c4) , Velimirovic (Bf1-c4, Bc1-e3, Qd1-e2, O-O-O) or Keres Attack (an early g2-g4) . The primary cost to avoiding early king-side development (or any preparation to remove Ke8 from the center) is that White has some attacking options. }

These are slight, but enduring positional advantages. I look at these two elements in terms of whether they help White to win: the bishops are considered a slight material advantage and the pawn majority is considered useful because their distance from the kings means that they can more easily be advanced (particularly in an ending) to create a passer which could promote. }

3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 Bb4+

{ After 5. Nc3 it's not so clear Black would've pulled the bishop back. He might have played 5...c6 or 5...O-O and waited to see if the Bb4 would prove to be of any use. }
6. Bg2
{ Generally, White's plan it to blast through the g2-a8 diagonal and to play on the queen-side. Bd2 is awkward at the moment, but could come into play at either f4 or g5. If Black plans to block the diagonal with ...c7-c6 then White builds-up more slowly in the center and aims for e2-e4 to overwhelm Classically. Black can aim for equalizing trades or aim to use his queen-side pawns to block and chase White's pieces (as perhaps in a QGA Alekhine's Variation) . It isn't so easy for Black to find a fixed target for a counter-offensive. }
6...O-O 7. O-O c6 8. Qc2 b6

 (8...Nbd7 
{ Fritz7 }) 9. Bf4 Ba6
{ This Queen's Indian-ish move is new to me. Whether it's the beginning of a new plan or just a short tactical shot before resuming the slower plan isn't clear. It has the benefit of forcing White to wait on Nb1-c3 and resolve the threat to Pc4 first. 10. b3 is probably alright, but with Bf4 the dark squares b2, a3 and c3 will be weaker than usual. }

{ This resupports Pc4 and controls e4, but blocks the d-file, so that Pd4 might be a little weak; it ties-up Nf3 to defending Pd4. }
10...Nbd7
{ I like this ordinary-looking move. It appears to be simple development, perhaps preparing ...Rc8 or controlling c5 & e5 (which it does) , but it might also be preparing ...Nf6-h5xf4 by avoiding Bf4xNb8. White's position isn't stagnant, but Black's looks plenty robust. }
11. Rfd1

11...Rc8 $6 $14
{ according to Fritz7; This might look a little risky as it leaves Ba6 & Pa7 exposed, but it evacuates the g2-a8 diagonal and prepares ...c6-c5. As long as Black has ...Bxc4 and Pe2 is en prise then it's tacticall sound; but just barely. }

{ This Pf4 will provide some central control, but it's sort of weak. Kg1 is also weakened, so Black need only keep a number of pieces to fight with and not too many weak spots and he should be alright. Immediately it appears Black has to break up some White pawns to avoid a big cramp. The question is whether to capture Pc4 or Pe4. Capturing Pe4 makes Kg1 look less safe, but capturing Pc4 makes Black's queen-side play look better. }
14...Nf6
{ That's a curious choice: delaying the pawn capture decision. I guess he thinks the threat to Pf4 (...Nf6-h5) will cause immediate and serious problems for White. }
15. Ne5 Nh5
{ Isn't it rather remarkable that Pf4 was so apart from the rest of the White pieces that White just let it go, so he could continue his main offensive plan, not worrying so much about his king's safety because Qd8 can't get to the king-side just yet. }
 (15...dxc4 16. Ndxc4 Nd5

{ Bc4 looks very crowded, but there's still d3 and e2 and as long as Pb5 is mobile the bishop might have time to retreat to b5 or a6 and as long as Pe4 remains then there's ...d5xe4 to open up d5 for the bishop. I think it's this kind of open position which gives Black's pieces more mobility and could lead to a serious king-side attack. But, first he must deal with the Nc6 and Qa4. A queen trade when White's knight would be in enemy territory at d8 (after 18. Nxe8 bxa4)  is risky for White to accept. }

19. Qxc6 Nxf4 20. Nxc4 bxc4 21. exd5 exd5
{ After this it appears play has to shift toward the king-side. However, Nf4 has to stay in place to keep Pd5 on the board, so there might be time for b2-b3 to continue on the queen-side. }
22. Rc3 Bh4 $5
{ This clears the way for ...Qd8-g5 and guards g3 to prevent Rc3-g3, but that rook has already been en prise (...Nf4-e2+) , so it doesn't make as much sense as ...Be7-b4, preventing b2-b3 and threatening to support ...c4-c3.

{ These two have played a couple of terrific games in recent events, so this one could be interesting too. }
2. Nf3
{ Why would Karpov play this move? It usually initiates a Colle System (e2-e3, Bf1-d3) , Torre Attack (Bc1-g5) or London System (Bc1-f4) and Karpov doesn't generally play any of those. I suppose he wants to see if Polgar intends to play a particular set-up or will reconsider over the board and perhaps play another set-up. }

{ is also interesting and preserves the option of ...g7-g6, ...Bf8-g7 without weakening d6 &f6 }) 3. c4

3...b6
{ Ironically it's this Queen's Indian Defense which Karpov himself has championed which is giving him problems (at least against Polgar) . }
4. a3
{ This is a move Kasparov has championed and brought out of obscurity, though it was (I think) originated by Petrosian (one of Kasparov's chessic heroes) . The idea is to be able to play Nb1-c3 without facing ...Bf8-b4 (again a move Karpov likes) . }
4...Bb7 5. Nc3 d5
{ Without ...Bf8-b4 Black has to use the central pawn to prevent White from taking complete control of the center. Without some central control (a fair share) one's position can be cramped and lateral movements become much more difficult. }
6. cxd5
{ This, instead of e2-e3, leaves open the option of Bc1-f4 or Bc1-g5; though one of those moves could be played immediately and Pc4 left to be defended indirectly by Qd1-a4+xc4. Perhaps he wants to see what specific set-up Black will choose (...Nxd4 or ...exd5) before committing his position further. }
 (6. Bg5 h6 7. Bxf6 Qxf6 8. cxd5 exd5 
{ Fritz7 }) 6...Nxd5
{ In the Ponomariov-Kramnik game of round two this same question came up and I criticized Kramnik for not recapturing at d5 with a pawn. In this game I don't see things the same way because Black already has Bb7 and control of e4 will be retained by Black for a few moves. Black simply refuses to allow White to take full control of the center and White's only attempt to gain the advantage probably lies in taking advantage of the weak e5 to threaten Ke8 and/or to advance f2-f3, e2-e4. }
7. Qc2 Nxc3 8. Qxc3 h6 $5
{ This prevents Bc1-g5 and ...Bf8-d6 can guard square f4 to prevent Bc1-f4 from gaining any lasting advantage. Usually you don't see a top GM playing this kind of extra pawn move early-on in a game. It certainly shows she's thinking for herself and not just playing stereotypical moves. }
9. e3 Nd7 10. b4
{ Fritz7 doesn't even mention this, liking Bf1-b5 or Bf1-e2 better. So, Bc1 might well be developed to b2. This looks like a concession by White, but in light of a game played by these two contestants in a previous event it makes great sense. Polgar played the Tarrasch Defense and showed a great willingness to take on open positions; here he stops ...c7-c5. Where will Black find offensive play; on the king-side I think, where Bb7 is "aimed". }

{ After this Fritz7 thought a while and suddenly all his variations went negative (good for Black) . }
14. Qb3
{ White prepares Nf3-e5 when the alignment of Rd1 with Qd8 makes it impossible for Black to break that bind. Black is also apparently unwilling to play ...Bxf3 since after gxf3 the square c6 would be severely weakened and with Rh1-g1 White would be ready to pounce on Pg7 and Kg8. So, Black fights the central bind and expects to succeed because White has yet to spend any moves on preparing O-O. }

1. e4
{ Anand's fight with Karpov has gone back further than that of Polgar & Karpov. And, as he has gotten stronger while Karpov faded a bit, he is now expected to win their matchups pretty often. That doesn't mean Karpov is terribly weak or easy to beat. }
1...c6
{ Karpov varies between this (Caro-Kann) and the Petrov's Defense these days. In his younger days he played the Black side of the Ruy Lopez (quite well) and even played some Sicilian Defense variations. }
2. d4 d5 3. e5
{ Curiously, it's the more closed positions with solidly blocked pawn structures which have given Karpov some trouble. That's been true in other openings as well. }
3...Bf5 (3...c5 
{ is out of fashion, but was once favored by Botwinnik }) 4. Nc3 e6 5. g4
{ This aggressive variation aims to "punish" Black for exposing his bishop without having anything immediate for it to do. Black depends upon his "solid" pawn structure to protect his king and to slow White's onslaught. }
5...Bg6 6. Nge2
{ White might follow-up with f2-f4-f5 or h2-h4-h5, but all lines require good piece activity and that's what gives Black a little time to develop and create some counter-play. }
 (6. h4 h5 
{ and how is White to continue if not to play a knight to f4? }
  (6...h6 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. Qxd3 
{ might have been played in the past, but today the  aim is to gain more time kicking Black's Bg6 around. }) ) 6...Ne7
{ This protects Bg6 and guards against f2-f4-f5, so White's offense will require a little more build-up and piece support. }
7. f4 c5
{ There is a risk that dxc5 can be supported or that Nc3-b5-d6 would occur quickly. White now has a fight all across the board. To add more force at the center White might consider Bf1-g2 before f4-f5, but there are some instances when Nc3-b5 needs the support from Bf1. }
 (7...h5 
{ Fritz7; This is a typical move to slow the offense. }) 8. Ng3
{ guarding e4 and preparing f4-f5 or dxc5 or Nc3-b5. This ought to create a small crisis for Black to solve. }
8...cxd4
{ Something else to give Bg6 room to move might be necessary; perhaps ...f6. }
 (8...f6 9. exf6 gxf6 10. dxc5 
{ Fritz7 }) 9. Nb5
{ There was a time when only Qxd4 would be considered. The idea of going around the central pawns with Nc3-b5 isn't new, but I think it's still fun to see. Nb5-d6+ would also support f4-f5 to win a piece. }
9...Nec6
{ Black allows f4-f5 and gains several pawns in exchange. It's a practical decision which one makes when the clock is running, but it's also one he might not play again. }
 (9...f6 10. exf6 gxf6 11. f5 exf5 12. Bf4 $16 
{ Fritz7 }) 10. f5 $16 Bc5 11. Nd6+
{ White is going to lose Pe5 and Nb5 can't retreat, so this forces Black to give his bishop for a knight to get it. }
 (11. fxg6 hxg6 12. a3 Nxe5 13. Bf4 Nbc6 $14 
{ Fritz7; It's strange how Fritz7 sees a position, gives it one evaluation and then following it's own suggestions a few moves down the line it switches the evaluation to something more tepid. }) 11...Bxd6 12. exd6 Qxd6 13. Bg2 f6 (13...Nd7 $14 
{ Fritz7 }) 14. fxg6 hxg6
{ Now is time to re-evaluate: White has an extra bishop, but Black has three pawns, all in the center of the board, clogging up lines. White's plan has to get rid of a few of those pawns to make way for the White pieces. }
15. O-O (15. Qd3 Ne5 16. Qxd4 Nbc6 17. Qa4 Qb4+ 18. Qxb4 Nxb4 19. Kd2 Nxg4 20. c3 Nc6 21. h3 Nge5 $11 
{ Fritz7; It takes a fine position and forces an odd series of moves which ends as "equal"; truly bizarre. }) 15...Nd7 16. Rf2
{ preparing c2-c3 by avoiding a ...Qd6-c5+ }
16...O-O-O 17. c3 dxc3 18. bxc3 Nb6
{ c3-c4 won't be so easy to accomplish as Black prevents it directly and in the event it's played Black also has ...d5-d4. So, White probably has to go farther afield to force lines open. He might also consider doubling rooks on the b-file to put a little pressure on before playing a2-a4-a5 or c3-c4. }
19. Nf1 Rd7 $11
{ Fritz7; Karpov recognizes that Pb7 is a weakness and he defends it first thing. }
20. h3
{ Evidently he wasn't so comfortable with his king's safety and decided to reorganize. At least this frees Nf1 to move about, though giving the opponent several free moves isn't usually a great thing. }
20...f5
{ This looks a little awkward, but it keeps a small threat in the vicinity of Kg1 and that will keep White tied-up a bit. }
 (20...g5) 21. Rb1 Rf8
{ I'm not certain whether this is to prepare ...fxg4 and to trade rooks or to prepare ...f5-f4 and a general pawn advance across the center. }
22. Qb3
{ threatening Bc1-a3 as well as perhaps a2-a4-a5 }
22...Rff7
{ The two Black rooks surrounded by pawns don't have much space. }
23. Qc2
{ keeping an eye on Pf5 and Pg6 to keep Black from becoming aggressive }
23...Rc7 (23...Nc4 
{ Fritz7 }) 24. Qd3 Na4
{ This is an aggressive move, aimed probably at ...Na4-c5-e4. Karpov is quite Classical and likes centralizing pieces. }
 (24...fxg4 25. Rxf7 Rxf7 26. hxg4 Nc4 $11 
{ Fritz7 }) 25. Bf4
{ I can't tell whether he feels the bishop is needed to keep Kg1 safe or if he is just prodding Black into weakening his pawns by advancing them. In any event, this alignment of Bf4 with Qd6 and Rc7 can't be bad. }

30. Nd2
{ White has to hold back Pe5 to gain time for maneuvering to free Bh2 (Kg1-g2, Bh2-g1, Rf2-f1) . }

{ I think it's time to re-evaluate again: Black's dark-square pawns are holding Bh2 at bay, but that won't last forever and White's light-square pieces can be challenged by ...Nb5-d6 or ...Nb5-c3. so, White has to continue acting fast to challenge Black's pawn mass at Pe5 or Pg5 (h3-h4 comes to mind) . }
35. Re1 Nc3 36. Bb3
{ Anand seems patient, but it could be he's avoiding more complicated lines, knowing full well that Black's pawns can't last long or that White will simply maneuver Bh2 out of the corner. In the event of ...e5-e4 he also has the simpler simplifying Bh2xf4, getting two pawns for the bishop and maintaining a slight endgame advantage. }
36...a5 37. Kf1 a4 38. Bc2
{ He keeps Pa4 under attack and Pa2 is defended by Rf2 when Bc2-f5+ is played. }
38...Kb7 39. Bf5 a3 40. Rc2 $18
{ There, now Bh2-g1 is possible (Fritz7 finally sees that piece!) and there is a favorable alignment on the c-file, so that White might force a simplifying rook trade to reach a very easy piece-plus ending. }

{ and Black's pawns quickly collapse }) 41. Bg1 Rc4 (41...e4 42. Bd4 Nb5 43. Bxe4 Nxd4  (43...Rxe4 44. Rxc6 Rxd4 45. Rg6 Rd7 46. Rb1 Rd5 47. Rxg7+ Ka6 48. Rb3 $16)  44. Bxc6+ Nxc6 45. Rxe7+ Nxe7 46. Rc3 $18) 42. Bf2 e4

1. e4
{ Topalov is one of the strongest natural tacticians in the world, so it's interesting that Timman would choose to play 1. e4. It usually leads to more open games where tactics are essential for success. }
1...c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5
{ So, here is Timman's first idea: to not play d2-d4, keeping the position closed. However, Bb5 (Rossolimo) might not be the best way to achieve the goal; 3. Nc3 is to be considered. }
3...d6
{ Perhaps Timman noticed that Topalov has been playing this particular move recently and thought he might exploit it in some way. I prefer 3...Qc7 to defend Nc6 with a piece, rather than allowing it to be pinned. }
4. d4
{ The threat of d4-d5 is obvious and Black isn't about to let White keep the central pawn duo. }
4...cxd4 5. Qxd4
{ Chekhover Variation - White might yet aim for c2-c4 to bind square d5 while Qd4 prevents ...g7-g6 and ...Bf8-g7 to play on dark squares. Of course, there are some who might play this variation with Nb1-c3 and aim for typical tactical themes like aligning Rd1 with Qd8 to apply pressure on the d-file. }
5...Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6
{ Black allows c2-c4, but he's got the two bishops and Ke8 is still relatively safe. }
7. Nc3
{ After giving up a bishop for knight it seems he would want to use c2-c4 to add extra force on the light square d5. I guess he decided that with Bc6 he shouldn't O-O, so he's going to want Pc2 when he has played O-O-O. }
7...Nf6 8. Bg5
{ This prevents Black's ideal development: ...g7-g6 and ...Bf8-g7. }
8...e6 9. O-O-O
{ After this White will be able to force doubled pawns on Black at f6 (unless Black foolishly plays ...e6-e5) , but the cost is further simplification. }
9...Be7 10. Rhe1 O-O 11. Kb1 h6 12. Bh4
{ So, if White can't force a weakness on Black then it appears Black has equalized. That isn't entirely true yet. Black has to show a way to activate his other pieces without White's already-developed forces having a major impact. }
 (12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. Qxd6 Bxc3 14. Qxd8 Rfxd8 15. Rxd8+  (15. bxc3 $2 Rxd1+ 16. Rxd1 Bxe4 $17)  15...Rxd8 16. bxc3 
{ when Black's B v. N and control of the d-file and White's crippled queen-side pawns make the game about equal }) 12...Qa5 13. Qd2
{ preparing Nf3-d4 with the threat of Nc3-d5 to force a trade of that knight for Be7 to weaken Pd6 & Nf6 }
13...Qh5
{ This is a surprising move (though Fritz7 likes it) because Black rarely finds the king-side to be a safe place for the queen in a Sicilian Defense. This particular position isn't like most others. With Nf3 and Bh4 in front of the pawns there's much less chance for White to threaten to entrap Qh5. }
 (13...b6 
{ defends Qa5, which would seem to prevent Nc3-d5, and gives Bc6 room to retreat along the good diagonal to b7; but Fritz7 found a tactic to disprove that }
 14. Nd5 exd5 15. Qxa5 bxa5 16. exd5 $14 
{ Fritz7 }) 14. h3
{ Not only does White threaten g2-g4, but g4-g5 would open the g-file for great benefit. }
 (14. Bg3 e5 
{ a typical move to protect the central pawns, but in this position it self-traps Qh5 on the king-side; I'm not certain this is a serious problem }
  (14...Rfd8 
{ might be a sufficient defense which avoids problems with Qh5 }) ) 14...g5 15. Bg3 (
{ There is apparently no time for }
 15. g4 Qg6 16. Bg3 Nxe4 17. Nxe4 Bxe4 $17) 15...e5
{ Timman couldn't have been too dissatisfied with this situation. Black has weakened d5 and his king's position and has self-trapped Qh5. But, the next question is how to exploit those factors; and that one is hard to answer. }
16. Qd3
{ With this move he doesn't give away his offensive plan. He is still thinking prophylaxis and prevents ...b7-b5 and over-protects Pe4, a la Nimzovitch. More direct might have been Nf3-h2, f2-f3, Nh2-g4 or Bg3-f2-e3 (intending g2-g4 and later h3-h4 to pry open the dark-squares near Kg8) . Fritz7 likes Nd5 and Qd3 a little better than Nh2. }
16...Rad8
{ Fritz7 preferred ...Rf8-d8, but I suspect Topalov was anticipating a need for Rf8 to support the advance of Pf7. Perhaps Topalov's idea was a bit over-optimistic. }
17. Nd2
{ He's certainly being cautious, but his position could be turned to offensive purposes as Nd2-f1-e3-f5 isn't at all prevented. There are numerous maneuvers and plans which could produce good results. }
17...d5
{ Apparently White didn't have this thematic move prevented as well as he'd thought. Black blows up the position and makes all White's caution irrelevant; of course, the cost of this is that White's pieces can come to life in the open position too, meanwhile Qh5 isn't really in play. Why was it possible for all those White positional advantages to simply evaporate(?) ; Piece Activity(!) . After Nf3-d2 Black's piece activity in the center turned out to be a little better (or at least no worse) than White's. }

{ And just like that Black is overwhelming White's pieces with an avalanche of pawns and it doesn't hurt Black that he has the two bishops. It's an amazing turn of events. }
22. f3 Rfd8 23. c3 Rxd4
{ Topalov doesn't shy from the exchange sacrifice as long as his pawns grow into monsters! }

{ according to Fritz7 }
25...Bd5 26. Qc2 e3 $15
{ Pe3 is huge and only the c-file is open to White's queen and rooks, though there won't be any entry squares at c7 or c8. Black is in charge. }
27. Ne4 Qf7
{ threat: ...Bxa2+ }
28. Nc3 Be6 29. d5 $11
{ Fritz7; giving Rd1 more room to breathe and forcing Black's Be6 to another square. If Pd5 could move one square further up the board there would be a chance for the White rooks to move onto the d-file, but it's very iffy because Pe3 always threatens to advance. White's job is to cut off the other Black pieces from supporting Pe3. Fritz7 apparently would've chosen a different approach, based on leaving Pd4, Qc2-a4, Re1-e2-c2 and then who knows what. }
29...Bf5 30. Ne4 Rxd5 $11
{ Fritz7; White tried the only thing possible and he's lost a pawn. It looks bad for White. }
31. Rxd5 Qxd5 32. Rd1 Qe6 33. Ka1

33...h5 34. a3 Kf7 35. Qa4
{ White's best chance now might be to catch Black's king in a perpetual check. Black has to advance his plan with some caution. }
35...Bxe4 36. fxe4

36...Bf6
{ Black will happily trade Pa7 for Pe4. }
37. Qc2 Qc6
{ White doesn't want a queen trade when his last hope is a perpetual check. In this particular instance White wouldn't even get to play Rd1-d5 since a Pc6 would control that square and Pe3 could advance to promote. }

41. g3 $1 $16

One could argue that whatever short-term benefits he's gaining from these moves that it doesn't restrain White for long and that Black's other pieces need to be brought into play. I think he might want to play his queen onto the c-file to defend Bc8, so he'd be prepared to play ...a7-a5 and so on. I think it's the inconsistency of the purpose of his plans which gives White a way to causes him problems. }

advantage in development . To make best use of this advantage it is very

Black would be foolhardy to play ...f7-f6 to try to weaken Nd6. It would only expose his king to renewed threats. }

1. e4 c5
{ Ponomariov is still new to the top-level tournaments, so I and the top GMs he faced at Wijk aan Zee are unfamiliar with him. Based on what I've seen of his style (which is Classical and generally cautious) I'd have expected 1. e4 e5. }

{ Despite the open look of this position it seems Ponomariov is playing in a Classical way, hoping to control the center, developing pieces and grabbing Pe4. Each is separate positional aspects. Anand, on the other hand, is forced, by the nature of this variation, to play more dynamically; for best piece positions in the center, gambiting Pe4 and then utilizing those advantages forcefully. }

{ It's time to re-evaluate: Black has an extra pawn and apparently a safe king. White has a lead in development and can target Black's knights, Pa6 and perhaps square b6 is a good invasion point. It seems to me White's plan could be Ne3-c4, Bc1-e3-b6, Nd5-c7+ and combined with that dark-square play he might also be able to play Ra1-e3 or Qd1-f3 to have some activity on light squares. }

{ a drastic measure, but perhaps correct. Now White will have a slight material advantage, but Black will keep his king safer. Does White take the material and then find he has no dynamic plan?

1. Nf3
{ After getting stomped on by Anand in the previous round it now appears Ponomariov wants a quieter and more closed position. }
1...Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3
{ It's impossible to know the intentions of someone who uses this move-order. He might want to play e2-e4 and then d2-d4 to achieve the full pawn center without allowing a Gruenfeld Defense or he might intend to play g2-g3 in any case. }
3...Bg7
{ Some players are still comfortable with a standard-issue King's Indian Defense. }
 (3...d6 
{ Allows Black to meet e2-e4 with ...c7-c5, if he wishes and is comfortable with a Maroczy Bind, which would occur after d2-d4 ...c5xd4. }) (3...c5) 4. e4 d6 5. d4 O-O 6. Be2 e5
{ This is most common, but there are alternatives. With this move Black aims to pressure White's pawn center, perhaps to play ...exd4 to open the g7-a1 diagonal for Black's Bg7. White can aim for an end-game with the Exchange Variation (7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8) or he can block the center with the Petrosian Variation (7. d5) or he can maintain the tension and see what develops; keeping an eye on Black's threats of course. }
 (6...Nc6)  (6...c6)  (6...Na6) 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5
{ In some lines White doesn't mind a pawn trade, but he rarely wants to allow a knight exchange along with it. It's considered much better to push Black's Nc6 back to keep Black cramped. }
8...Ne7 9. b4
{ Bayonet Variation - feared for a time, it's now considered strong, but not overwhelming. White aims for c4-c5 and holds off on maneuvering pieces. }
9...Nh5
{ preparing ...f7-f5 and in some cases ...Nh5-f4 }
10. Re1 (10. c5 Nf4 
{ threatening ..Nxe2 to trade-off a minor piece before going forward with ...f7-f5 }
 11. Bxf4 exf4 12. Rc1 
{ was the main Bayonet sub-variation for a long time. When Rf1-e1 was played successfully it became "all the rage". }) 10...f5 (10...h6 11. Nd2 Nf4  (11...Nf6 $4 $16 
{ and White has his offense well under-way while Black has  nothing })  12. Bf1 
{ is better for White }) 11. Ng5
{ This is one of the unusual features of the Bayonet Variation. As far as I know, it's the only King's Indian Defense variation where the knight goes on this adventure. }
11...Nf6 12. f3
{ secures e4, but allows ...Nf6-h5, weakens Kg1 and fixes the pawn structure, so Black will have time to think about how to go around it. }
 (12. Bf3 $5) 12...Kh8
{ This is an interesting approach: Black expects Ng5-e6 to be played eventually, so he just keeps his coordination good and considers ways to regain perfect control of e6 (...Ne7-g8, ...Qd8-e7 for example) . }
 (12...h6 13. Ne6 Bxe6 14. dxe6 
{ and then Black's attention would be focused on getting rid of Pe6 while maintaining his coordination. }) 13. Rb1 h6 14. Ne6 Bxe6 15. dxe6 fxe4
{ Black fixes White pawns on light squares to hinder Be2 and it also ends the possbility of e4xf5 to loosen-up Black's king-side. }
16. fxe4 Nc6 $1
{ This is more aggressive than ...Ne7-g8 and Nc6 has square d4, so Black's position looks very good. It's up to White to show he can hold Pe6 or create an offense, somewhere on the board as compensation. }
17. Nd5
{ sort of threatening b4-b5 and e6-e7. Though Black could easily respond with ...Nc6-e7 it's not the move Black really wants to make. }
17...Ng8
{ So, Black redefends square e7, keeping Nc6 free to move Nc6-d4xe6. Nd5 has the effect of keeping Pe6 safe from Black's queen because it also threatens Pc7. }
18. Bd3 Nd4 19. Qg4
{ More support for Pe6, just in the nick of time. Now Black can consider ...c7-c6 to kick Nd5 away, but he also has to consider how he will defend Pg6. }
19...g5 $5
{ It's really odd that Black would move this pawn near his king, but it does avoid Black having pieces on awkward squares. I suppose Black is thinking about ways to fight on the light squares and he can't be defending too much if he expects to play offense. }
20. Qh3
{ threatening e6-e7 with Bc1xg5 to follow }
 (
{ It seems to me the big test is }
 20. h4 gxh4 21. e7 $2 Nxe7 22. Bxh6 Bxh6 23. Qxh4 Ng8 $19) 20...c6 21. Ne3 (21. e7 Nxe7 22. Bxg5 cxd5 23. Bxh6  (23. exd5 Qc8 24. Bxe7 Qxh3 25. gxh3 Nf3+ 26. Kh1 Nxe1 27. Rxe1 Rf3 $13)  23...Qc8 24. Qh4 $11) 21...Qf6
{ Finally Black has Pe6 in mortal danger and there is the immediate threat of ...Qf2+, mating. }
22. Ng4 Qe7
{ keeping an eye on Bc1xg5 }
23. Be3 Nxe6
{ Black's plan is succeeding very nicely. He's kept his position intact and won Pe6. Now, in theory he should be able to start offering piece trades to win with his extra pawn. In practice it might take a bit more work than that. }
24. g3 Qd7
{ It looks like he's aligning with Qh3, but it's possible he means to bring ...Ng8-e7-g6 (or somesuch) or to advance ...d6-d5. }

{ Allowing Pe4 to move and release Bd3 can't be good. }

{ is one way to keep real pressure on Black's king }
 32...Qe6 
{ Fritz7 has another view of things. It sees the bigger picture (in a tactical sense) and knows the White king-side attack isn't winning, so he finds a variation which few people would even consider. }
 33. Rb2 Qc4 34. Rf2 Rxf2+ 35. Nxf2 Qxb4 36. hxg5 hxg5 $17) 31...Nc2
{ I think this is a critical position for both players. White has asserted some offense and Black has "stated" his position is impregnable. Then there is also the possibility for Black to play offense, but it's not clear whether it works. Black's first effort at an incursion occurs when White's Qh5 and Bf7 are amazingly out of position to respond in defense and Rb1 can't easily get into play. But are they needed? }
 (31...Nf6 $5 
{ Fritz7's second favorite move, but one I think is pretty neat, for all the curious variations which can arise from it. }

{ If White can't continue the attack with Bc5xf8 then he's at a standstill and Black's attack will probably win. Apparently Radjabov has fended-off the FIDE champion's attack and has counter-attacked successfully. Ponomariov must have been shocked and dismayed to be dismissed so efficiently. }

36...Nxe3 37. h4 (37. Qh5 g4) 37...Qe2 38. Qh5 g4
{ Ironically, White can't prevent Black from invading on the light squares (e.g. ...Qe2-f3-g2#) . Pono must have wondered why he wasn't able to involve Rb1 more. Radjabov had to be jubiliant to have succeeded so well. }

I suppose the position might transpose to a Scheveningen Variation, but Polgar doesn't usually play that line. In short, I don't see any winning plan emerging for White with Qd2. What is the big threat White might be aiming to make? }

1. e4 e5
{ Ponomariov is one of the most classically-oriented players around who still plays 1. e4 (occasionally) and does well with it. Karpov used to play 1. e4, but now only plays 1. d4. However, with the Black pieces the two are very different: against 1. e4 Ponomariov has played 1...c5 a few times in this event while Karpov plays 1...c6 or 1...e5. Their understanding of the game might be similar, but Pono has youth and Karpov has tremendous experience. For those who know how to handle it 1...e5 has been doing quite well the last few years. But, that success hasn't been with the Spanish Game as much as with the Scotch Game (by White's choice) or the Russian Game/Petrov's Defense. Black seeks a little simplification and more open space to develop pieces with both of those. }
2. Nf3

{ White seeks to undermine Ne4 and gain sole control of the d3-h7 diagonal. }
8...Nf6
{ This is a lot less contentious and, as is Karpov's style, more cautious than the other plans available (see variations below) , but with a plan: he'll probably aim for ...dxc4 and control of d5 and offense against Pd4. }

{ With a more static position it becomes important to prevent ...Bc8-g4. Ph3 also helps secure Bc1-e3. If Black wants to play ...Bc8-e6 he might consider ...h7-h6 to prevent Nf3-g5xe6. }
9...Nb4 10. Be2 dxc4 11. Bxc4 O-O (11...Bf5 $11 
{ Fritz7 }) 12. Nc3 c6
{ Karpov prefers positions with relatively fixed positional elements upon which he can base his plans. He likes to out-maneuver his opponents, rather than basing his offense on direct attacks on the opponent's king. }

{ Black has solid control of d5, but at the cost of making Nb6 passive. White has room to develop, but it's not clear there is any point in Black's position he can assault. That's a typical situation in games with Karpov. }
16...Bd5
{ Black has terrific control of d5. White could trade Nc3xd5, but that wouldn't help matters much. The direct threat of ...Bd5xf3 must be answered. }
 (16...h6 $11

{ White admits his loss of control of d5 and makes use of the advanced e5. Ne5 also prevents Black from playing a piece to c4. }

 17...Re8) 18. Bf4 Re8
{ Having made Ph6 an obvious target Karpov now plans ...Be7-f8 to make it very safe. }
19. Re2
{ Ponomariov is activating his pieces in small ways and not committing to any specific plan; he likes to maintain his position's coordination. In this respect he's very similar to Karpov. }
19...Be6
{ threatening ...Qd8xd4 and perhaps wanting to chase away Bf4 by ...Nd5 }

{ Karpov might have missed an opportunity. }
 20...Nfd5 21. Bg3 Bg5 $15 
{ Fritz7 }) 21. Rae1 Nbd5 22. Bg3
{ This eliminates the threat of a sacrifice at h6 once and for all. Now the middle-game begins anew, with Karpov happy to have a safe king and harmonious position and sole control of d5. Ponomariov is also well developed, but he must find an offense sufficient to counterbalance the weakness of Pd4. What will the target be? }
22...Rc8
{ I suppose Karpov was aiming for ...c6-c5 to simplify the position and completely equalize. }
 (22...Bb4 23. Qc1 Nh5 24. Bh2 Qg5 $11 
{ Fritz7 }) 23. Bh4 $1
{ I like this a lot. The bishop seemed to be inactive and he just moves it to a good square. Now White might be able to continue with Nd3-e4 or Bd3-b1, Qd2-d3, renewing the threat of invasion at h7. }
23...g5 $5
{ Wow! When Karpov makes a move which weakens his king this way, it's saying a lot. He clearly had to have considered all the alternatives and found them wanting. }
 (23...Be7 
{ to break the pin and give Kg8 more air might be good }) 24. Bg3
{ Well, that little provocation worked wonders. Now White has a clear target in Pg5, though Black also has ...Bf8-g7 to guard the dark squares around Kg8. }
24...Nh5
{ Does he plan ...Nh5xg3 or something more ambitious like ...f7-f5-f4? Pono obviously thought the latter was a real threat and he immediately fights for control of f5! }
25. Nxd5 Nxg3 26. fxg3
{ White might well switch his rooks to the f-file to target Pf7. But at this point a lot begins to hinge on how much time one has to carry out a specific plan (move-sequence) . }
26...cxd5
{ If ...Be6xd5 then f5 is in White's hands, so I thought ...Qd8xd5 was the move. Maybe Karpov thought Bd3-c4 to eliminate Be6 would be too strong. }
 (26...Qxd5 27. Bc4 Qd6 28. Ng4 
{ threatens Ng4-f6+ or Bc4xe6 and Black can't avoid this with ...Be6xc4 because of Re2xe8, winning material }

{ Mark & Fritz7 }) 31. Rxe6 hxg4 32. Re5
{ This is very nice. He threatens Bf5xc8 and if the bishop can move with a threat Re5xg5. He might also just play Bf5xg4 and Re5xd5 to simplify to an endgame where he's ahead materially. }
32...Rc7 33. Bxg4 Be7 34. Rxd5 $16
{ It's amazing, when you see a game such as this, just how simple it can be. White is ahead two pawns, but one is doubled, so he still has some work to do before this is easily winnable. Pd4 could advance and he might still threaten Pg5 (though that seems less likely to be successful with Be7 defending) and the queen-side pawns are a little exposed while Black's queen is stuck at g7. }
34...Qg6 35. Kh2 Qb6
{ Well, that guards the queen-side! Karpov can recognize the stable elements of a position as well as anyone. So, how does White win? There's an old saying that when there are "opposite color" bishops then "he who is attacking has the extra bishop". So, White might aim to trade rooks to limit counter-play and then go right back to the attack at f7 & h7. }
36. b3 Bf6 37. Bf3 Kg7 38. Be4 Re7 39. Bd3
{ Rd5 looks a little awkward, but Bd3-c4 would keep it safe. The question is how to move it to clear the way for Pd4 to advance. It seems Rd5-f5, d4-d5 and White is in excellent position to play offensively at all the right points. }
39...Qe6 40. Bc4 Qe4
{ keeping Rd5 tied to the d-file }
41. Qd1 b6
{ Fritz7 prefers ...a7-a6 or ...g5-g4 to fight more for the light squares. }
42. Rd6 Rc7 43. Qf3 $1
{ Taking advantage of the fact Qe4 isn't defended gives him a chance to maneuver away from Pd4. Black is also stuck because he needs to pressure Pd4, but White is aligned on Bf6. I suppose a queen trade under other circumstances would be fine, but in this case it undoubles White's pawns. Black has a serious problem. }
 (43. a4 Qe7 44. Rd5 Rd7 45. Rxd7 Qxd7 46. d5 
{ and despite the opposite color bishops Fritz7 still thinks White is winning. }) 43...Qxf3 (43...Qg6 44. Qd5 
{ and Rd6-d7 to hit Pa7, Rc7 and Pf7 }) 44. gxf3 b5 45. Bd3 Rc3 46. Be4 Re3
{ Karpov is angling for ...Re3-e2+xa2 or possibly ...Rd?xd4 to force a rook trade and retrieving a draw. }
47. h4 $1 $16
{ Fritz7 drops his evaluation a bit; probably because there's less material and the offensive tactical threats are less. This pawn sacrifice gives the king some air and keeps the game going. White's rook will have some play on the queen-side, so Black's active rook won't eliminate too many pawns. }

{ Every pawn he can get rid of safely is one less potential queen. }
49. Kh3
{ Now the position remains balanced, with White's Pd4 being the one unblocked advantage. Black has to be careful though to not allow Re3 to be cut-off from his other pieces, such that none of them can do anything because they don't work together. }

 50. d5 Re2 51. Bd3 Rxa2 52. Bxb5 $16) 50. Kg4 a5
{ White was threatening Rd6-a6xa7, so he had to move the pawn onto a safer square. Black would like to play ...b5-b4 to fix White's pawns and then ...Re3-e2 would grab at least one. }
51. Kf5
{ This king position hinders Black's king, so the threat to Pf7 will pack more punch. It's also closer to Pd4, so that in some endings the king will be well placed to defend either Pd4 or Pf3. }

{ Thus simplifying the situation: White's king and pawn will defeat Black's rook after ...Rh8xd8 and then the remaining White bishop and pawns will easily beat Black's two pawns. White probably wouldn't even go after Pb4. He'd just push Black's king away and advance Pf5. This was a terrific game to see. Karpov isn't quite as sharp as in younger days he's still tough to beat several younger players have shown recently that they can do it. }
